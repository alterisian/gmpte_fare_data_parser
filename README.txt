Goal:

Take the sample fare data from GMPTE and parse it into a useable form.

Part 2:
I'll probably expand it to populate a Rails app, but thought the RegEx is going to be reusable by others.

Any help needed?
I'm not RegEx expert, so if you have any optimisations please feel free to lend a hand.

Languages:
Ruby (eventual) + RegEx foo
